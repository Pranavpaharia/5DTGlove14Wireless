# 5DTGlove14Wireless
This project uses 5DT c++ sdk to communicate with 5DT glove in a windows console based application. There are three config files. 
- GloveInputL ,
- GloveInputR & 
- StandardInputFile

All the standard Input Keys are mentioned in StandardInputFile. Please check which key you want to bind with glove gesture from the StandardInputFile and then use the same Key name in GloveInput configs. Please note this file only maps gesture of 5DT Data Gloves to any keybutton you like, even mouse clicks.
